# GameRecord

This is a web application to track board games: their ratings, play counts, and other metadata

## Steps 
Step 1: Initial commit with basic files
- Files Added:
 - `readme.md`
 - `app.mjs`
 - `style.cs`
 - `index.html`
- Functionality:
`index.html` contains a basic HTML5 scaffold with references to `app.mjs` and `style.css`

Step 2: Create Game class
Objective: Define a Game class that reflects the data structure provided in example.json

- Changes:
 - Created a models folder
 - Added `game.mjs` which exports game class as default
 - imported the game class into `app.mjs`

Step 3: Implementing LocalStorage Operations
Objective: Create functions for saving, retrieving, exporting, and importing fames using localStorage

- Changes:
 Storage Functions:
 - `saveGameToLocalStorage(gameObj)`: Generates a unique key for each game and saves it
 - `getAllGamesFromLocalStorage()`: Retrieves all saved games by checking for keys that start with "Game-"
 - `exportAllGamesAsJSON()`: Exports all games as a JSON string
 - `importAllGamesFromJSON(jsonString)`: Imports and saves games from a JSON string
- These functions were eventually moved to a new file (storage.js) for clarity and avoid circular dependencies 

Step 4: Adding File Import & In-Memory Game Array
Objective: 
  Allow users to import a JSON file (e.g., `example.json`) into localStorage
- Changes: 
  - Updated `index.html` to include an `<input type="file" id="importSource">`
  - Added FileReader functionality in `app.mjs` to import JSON data
  - Created an in-memory array `games` that is populated from localStorage whenever the app loads

Step 5: Rendering Game Records in the UI
Objective: 
  Dynamically create a visual representation of each game in the UI
- Changes:  
  - Updated `index.html` to include a container (`<section id="gameList">`) for displaying games
  - Wrote the `renderGames()` function in `app.mjs` to loop through the `games` array and create HTML elements for each game
  - Displayed key details like game title, metadata, playCount, and a range input for rating

Step 6: Making PlayCount and Rating Interactive
Objective:  
  Allow the UI elements for playCount and rating to update the game data
- Changes:  
  - Added a "+" button to increment the playCount
  - Attached event listeners to the rating slider to update the gameâ€™s rating in real time
  - Made sure changes are saved back into localStorage via the storage functions

Step 7: Adding UI for New Game Entry
Objective: 
  Create a form in the UI to add a new game.
- Changes:  
  - Updated `index.html` by adding input fields (for name, year, players, time, difficulty, designer, artist, publisher, bgg link, playcount, rating,) and a button with `id="addGameBtn"`
  - This form is used in Step 8 to capture and save the data for a new game

Step 8: Implementing New Game Addition Functionality
Objective: 
  Enable the UI from Step 7 so that users can add new games
- Changes: 
  - Added event listeners in `app.mjs` to capture data when the "Add Game" button is clicked
  - Constructed a new `Game` object based on the form inputs
  - Saved the new game to localStorage and pushed it to the in-memory `games` array
  - Called `renderGames()` to update the displayed list

Step 9: Deleting a Game Entry
Objective:  
  Allow users to delete a game from the record
- Changes:  
  - Added a "Delete" button for each game within the `renderGames()` function
  - Implemented a `removeGameFromLocalStorage(gameObj)` function in `storage.js` to remove the game entry from localStorage
  - Updated the in-memory `games` array accordingly and re-rendered the list after deletion

Step 10: Sorting Game Listings
Objective: 
  Enable sorting of the game listing based on players, rating, difficulty, or playCount
- Changes:  
  - Added a `<select>` element in `index.html` for sorting criteria
  - Implemented the `sortGames(criteria)` function in `app.mjs` which sorts the `games` array based on the selected criteria
  - Re-rendered the game list after sorting is applied
